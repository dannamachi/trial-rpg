A strange statue
Me|This is...a statue?
Me|A statue, almost pristine, in the middle of nowhere...suspicious!
Me|Maybe it's a part of a magic spell...
Me|That means beside setting up the necessary elements, I also need a mana source for this.
Me|Then I'll be able to open this formation and take what's being kept inside!

Remnant of the past
Me|Something is carved onto the tree here...let's see.
Me|"Four lights, diamond"
Me|"Three up and down"
Me|"Two left and right"
Me|Whatever could this mean?

The altar
Me|It's not much, but this is an altar.
Me|This might be able to diable the magic that's sealing this place
Me|I need something to start the ritual...like a fire
Me|I also need something that can point to the sealing magic...do I have something like that?

Observe the magic
Me|This sealing magic is hard to crack...I can't even find any trace of it
Me|They must've hidden the core of the magic somewhere around here
Me|But I can't sense it...there must be another spell at play
Me|I have to find the core of the magic!

Escape the seal
Me|They've set up a sealing magic here...
Me|I have no time! Must hurry up and escape this before it gets too dark!
